          Database Development
        </h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
          A crucial component of our project's success was the establishment of
          a streamlined and comprehensive plant database. Our team focused on researching
          and collecting data on plant species that were best suited for the Orange
          County region, given its long-standing drought conditions and the fact
          that several team members call it home. To create the database, we developed
          multiple Python and Java scripts that scraped reputable sources such as
          the USDA Plants Database for plant species that best exemplified Xeriscaping
          traits. We then formatted the plants into a modular framework that we creatively
          named "plants". Throughout our project's development, the database underwent
          about 12 different iterations, ranging from as few as 17 plants to as many
          as 12,383. The database currently used by our website contains approximately
          500 plants, identified through their frequency in our searches and strong
          correlations with Xeriscaping characteristics.

          The most hands-on, time intensive aspect of our project was by far creating
          the website. This website, much like Rome, was not built in a day. Unlike
          Rome however, it was built in three days. Over a grueling 72 hour process
          with limited sleep and unlimited caffeine, we went from no experience in
          html, css, or javascript to having a fully-functional, and if I do say
          so myself, aesthetically pleasing website. Thank you Hayden for developing
          the website. All the files pertaining to this website are available on
          Haydenâ€™s Github.
