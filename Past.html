          Our Past

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">
          Since the start of our FFC/GCI program, a school-sponsored program that
          allows students to work on a project of their choosing, we knew we wanted
          our project to be focused on addressing the pressing issue of climate change.
          In our search for solutions, we came across Xeriscaping, a promising but
          lesser-known practice that can significantly reduce water usage and promote
          healthy, native plant growth in any landscape. Recognizing the lack of
          awareness around Xeriscaping, we set out to devise a way to bring it to
          the masses. After weeks of researching and brainstorming, we concluded
          that with our software engineering and data science backgrounds that creating
          an app would have the greatest reach and the most significant impact in
          encouraging users to adopt Xeriscaping. Before creating the app, we needed
          to deepen our understanding of Xeriscaping, so we delved into case studies
          around the world and consulted with experts to gain a comprehensive understanding
          of the practice. Unfortunately, given time constraints, we were not able
          to complete a full working app, and decided that creating a website (you’re
          here right now!) would be similarly accessible. Before switching over to
          creating a website, we created a full, working wireframe of the app that
          even included limited functionality (
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vNUYCIvRN0iu84F75JNQNo/Xeriscaping-App-UI?type=design&node-id=86-35&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A335&starting-point-node-id=86%3A35"
          target="_blank">
            Link to our wireframe if you’re interested
          </a>
          ). Our vision was to create an app that would help users identify the
          most suitable plants for their local environment, empowering them to easily
          create their own Xeriscaped gardens and make a positive impact on both
          their wallets and the environment.
